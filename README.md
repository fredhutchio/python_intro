# Introduction to Python

## Description

Description: This four-week course is designed to introduce attendees to Python programming and its broad applications. 
Each two hour session will include brief tutorials interspersed with challenge exercises, and assumes attendees have 
no prior computer coding experience. At the end of this course, you will be able to use Python to import, manipulate, 
and visualize data.

## Resources

* Each week's materials are described in the python script prefaced with the number of the week. 
* Data used for this lesson are identical to that used in [Introduction to R](https://github.com/fredhutchio/R_intro);
details on obtaining these data from the [National Cancer Institute's Genomic Data Commons](https://gdc.cancer.gov) 
can be found in that lesson repository.
* `exercises/` includes a file for each week representing both the aggregated in-class exercises as well as additional 
supplemental exercises for practice
* `solutions/` includes the solutions for all files in `exercises/`
* `resources.md` includes useful links mentioned during lessons; additional information about continued learning in Python as 
well as Hutch-specific resources can be found on the 
[Data Science Wiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/bioinformatics/prog_overview/)
* `hackmdio.txt` is an archive of the [interactive webpage](https://hackmd.io) used during lessons
